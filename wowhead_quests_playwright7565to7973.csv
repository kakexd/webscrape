Last edited by Obika on 2022/09/25 | On wowpedia they keep a record of when something is added or changed in the game. This quest is noted with: ""Patch 3.3.0 (2009-12-08): Added.""

Also the reward here on wowhead is marked with ""This item is not available to players.""

So this quest wont be available for a long time..."

7704,Look at the Size of It!,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7704,"Seeing this quest here but not in the game as well as the odd absence of comments from classic / vanilla days of thottbot and allakazam, I did some digging around. From my research online and on this site, this quest should not be here on the WoWHead Classic version as it did not exist during classic / vanilla days. The earliest I could find was that it was added towards the end of WotLK but likely with the Cata revamp. While the quest giver did apparently exist during classic / vanilla, she did not give out nor receive any quests from what I could find. This also applies to the other quest associated with this: Kill 'Em With Sleep Deprivation."

7722,What the Flux?,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7722,"Subject: ""<Blank>""
this place is not quite as easy to find as everyone says... i ran around quite a bit after reading every one of these posts...

There was a post above that was on the right track but got a little hazy.

Second cave To the left (theres 5 caves in the cauldron, get the 2nd one.

Best way is to take the elevator located next to one of the 3-4 cranes on the north edge.

Once inside the cave, you might notice along the back wall ""Quarry Gate"" go through that. Follow the quarry around, it bends to the right mostly.
High levels can sneak around easily.

You'll see a lot of ""Slave Worker""s and ""Dark Iron Slaver""s. Eventually you come to a big room with ""Dark Iron Taskmaster""s and an elemental named ""Obsidion"" on its back getting repaired by ""Enslaved Archeologist""s. (they walk back and forth from ""Ob"" to some tools thing or something) you'll see to the south-east of that guy, a big ramp. Go up that.

At the top is a small room with some other guy ""Blackheart"" i think was in his name, i killed him too fast to care. (i was really frustrated)

You venture into what seems like a bunk room. (beds all along the walls benches/stools in the middle) No worries you're on the right track. Slightly past there, follow the right wall and you'll see a balcony, maybe a mob or two. Pass that, keep following the right wall, and you'll see another balcony with Overseer Maltorius, the plans are behind him.

In cosmos, 42,35 was the loc where i could stare right at him.

I hope this helps.
- --Zindaklu of Thunderhorn | If you just want to dash in and get the scroll, then take off, you might have some ways of dealing with the elites, depending on your class.

Priests can use psychic scream

Warriors can use intimidating shout

Mages, depending on how good your timing is, might be able to get away with using frost nova

Hunters and Warlocks may be able to get away with distracting the mobs with their pet long enough to grab the item and make a getaway | They are right behind Overseer Maltorius.
Loc: 40,36 | It's down in The Slag Pit, on a table behind three Elite mobs.

http://imagesocket.com/view/whattheflux2740.jpg | Enter the cave for the Secret Plans: Fiery Flux @ 49,46. Stay to the left and don't fall ;D. Becarful of the elites, on the balcony part.. If your in a group might as well do https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7701 as well | Completing this quest will allow you to turn in various items in return for reputation with the Thorium Brotherhood, that when high enough allows you to buy various crafting recipes.

The first turn-in quests:

Restoring Fiery Flux Supplies via Heavy Leather (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8242)
Restoring Fiery Flux Supplies via Iron (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8241)
Restoring Fiery Flux Supplies via Kingsblood (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7736)

The turn-in quests are level 60, and if you have problems with this quest, you can just wait until you're in your high 50's and grab the plans without aggroing the the nearby mobs, as they will be gray to you.

On the other hand, the nearby elite, Maltorius, is also a target of the quest WANTED: Overseer Maltorius (https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7701), so you might want to kill him anyway. | Subject: ""Coords and Hints""
The item is behind the big nasty Overmaster Maltorius (50elite) and his two lovely guards (48elite), in the Cauldron, Slag Pit, 40,35. | Subject: ""Coords""
for everyone that doesnt give a schit about how someone did this, its at 41,36 in the slag pit."

7725,Again With the Zapped Giants,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7725,"This quest awards 25 reputation the first time, 5 each other times.

Interesting thing to note is this is one of the very few quests that doesn't hurt your Bloodsail reputation. Hence if you wanna have a friendly reputation with both the goblins and the pirates, this is one of the best quest to be done repeatedly. | Subject: ""Quest Info""
1. It is repeatable, but, since both items needed are quest items, you need to accept the quest to do it. Kind of a classic repeatable quest.

2. For those getting attacked by guards in the Goblin cities, while neutral... it's simple... YOU STARTED THE NON-DUEL FIGHT! Whoever starts the fight, gets mobbed by the goblin bruisers.

3. This is the only way to increase your reputation with the goblins of the Steamwheeldle Cartel, as a whole. Otherwise, there is a repeatable for Gadgetzan alone. Only reason to gain reputation with them is to hit Honored, for the 10% discount in their cities. | Subject: ""Rep gain nerfed in 1.9""
As of patch 1.9 this quest only gives 25 to Cartel factions each time, down from 75. | Subject: ""Mountain giants work, too""
The mountain giants in the NW corner of the map can also be shrunk. So, this quest can be completed at the same time as the Horde ""mountain giant muisek"" quest. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
But you get 21s! How can you beat that! | Subject: ""<Blank>""
The Zapper says it only lasts 2 hours, that's why.

Just drop the quest and pick it up again, you will still have all of the Miniaturization Residue from previous kills."
7726,Refuel for the Zapping,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7726,"Subject: ""<Blank>""
It's listed as level 55 so level 60s can get some mileage out of it.  Many of the repeatable reputation quests in the game are low level, which makes doing them at level 60 incredibly tedious.  This quest, however, is high enough level it will never go grey, and you will always get the full reputation reward. | This quest is repeatable. | Subject: ""Refueling.""
I just did this quest 3 or 4 times as a 46 hunter.  Though the mobs are cake the drop rate is horrible.  Also i gained no experience after the first turn in.  All turns after the first were only 21s and 25rep. If you are a questing nerd like me you should have all of these places at honored already if you quested all of Ratchet, Booty Bay and Tanaris.

My opinion.. waste of time repeatable.."

7728,STOLEN: Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7728,"The Tuyere is only dropped by Dark Iron Steamsmiths. There are only a few that spawn, about 5 or 6 i think. They're near the steamery at 39,50.

The spyglass is dropped by Dark Iron Lookouts. You can find them near the towers that surround the cauldron. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
I didn't even have to kill a steamsmith, I stared him down hard and he gave it back and appologized. | Just to help clarify, the steamsmiths are directly south of Kalaran Windblade. They are up top, before the elevator that lowers you into the gorge.

I spent a lot of time wandering around in the caves below and couldnt find em... heh | I've killed 30-40 steamsmiths without a Tuyere so far, I'm fairly sure the quest giver is misinformed these obviously didn't steal it. | Subject: ""Coordinates""
Found steamers around 40,50 (or at least in that vicinity), and lookouts at 33,52.

Got the Tuyere on my fourth steamer and the spyglass on my second lookout.  But liked the $$ and xp so much, I hung around and wiped the area... | This quest seems madness in Classic WoW. We tried to do this as a group of 5 to share spawns, but we ended up killing steamsmiths for nearly an hour to no avail. We are unsure if the quest is intentionally bugged or not. | Subject: ""<Blank>""
Smithing Tuyere just dropped off a Dark Iron Steamsmith for me. Took me a while considering there arent many of them. | Subject: ""<Blank>""

7729,JOB OPPORTUNITY: Culling the Competition,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7729,"Subject: ""COORDS""
They are near 43, 42  and surrounding areas in little camps. | Subject: ""Loads of em""
There are lots of them in 41,28. Go to around 40,50 look for a hole in the ground with a broken lift... then jump onto the life and jump the rest of the way... be prepared for battle though when you drop. There are 100's of Taskmasters and Slavers down here. you can also go in via the cave entrance. | These guys populate camps just southeast from Thorium Point and you can also find some inside the Cauldron."

The cord is:

7829,Hunt the Savages,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7829,"The Owlbeast share their spawns with the Silvermane Stalkers. So if you can´t find any Savage Owlbeasts just kill more Stalkers. | Subject: ""Silly spawn""
The tricky thing about this quest, is that the wolves and the savages share the same spawnpoints.

Ie. if u kill a wolf, a savage will spawn

Either that or the savages just felt like spawning at the time i started mutilating wolves | Subject: ""Spawning""
I found most of them at 56:53 (North of Altar of Zul) and the easiest way of getting them to spawn is to kill the Silvermane Stalkers. If you don't kill the Silvermane Stalkers there will be no more spawns as far as I know.
I'm also pretty sure that it doesn't effect the spawn if it's day or night. | Subject: ""Wolves and Owlbeasts share SAME spawn points""
I agree with Treigzak (see above). After hours of trying to find owlbeasts, I decided t give up and look around on Thottbot for answers.

The tricky thing about this quest, is that the wolves and the savages share the same spawnpoints.

Ie. if u kill a wolf, a savage will spawn

Either that or the savages just felt like spawning at the time i started mutilating wolves

After seeing Treigzak's post, I decided to kill some wolves to see if they had the same spawn points. in fact, they HAD.
After killing around.. 10 wolves, owlbeasts started to appear.

so.. the lack of owlbeasts is probably due to people skirting around them to find and kill the owl beasts

Just so people are clear and not mistaken by some misinformation being put by some here, the plume drops off a gryphon like those used in Alliance flight paths, and are easy to find if you wonder about a bit.

It is not a named mob, ""Razorbeak Skylord"" is the name of the gryphon type. | Subject: ""Skylords""

I believe the location people tend to overlook is the abandoned troll area with the Silvermane Stalker in it. | It took me a while to find this since I had no idea it spawned on top of Skulk Rock. I was actually heading over there to grab some ghost mushroom from the cave and saw the bucket sitting up there.

I would reccomend just keeping an eye out for this while you do other quests rather than running around solely to find this.

You will most likely see it in the course of doing other things... just make sure you have this quest before you go running around the Hinterlands. | Subject: ""Found them""
I have located the tools at the ruins at the right of Shaol'Watha.

Coords: 72,52 | Subject: ""I didn't find the tools in a troll camp""
Found them on top of Skulk Rock. | Subject: ""3 camps""
i spent an hour walking back and forth between two of the camps with the log spike walls, as well as the ruins to the East.  I even checked skulk rock.  I later realized that there are 3 of these camps, one is just further west. annyways it was in that west most camp that I ofund the tools, just killed the two guards inside the camp.  And btw you can look into the camps to see if the tools are there without engaging the mobs, especially if your mounted, or better yet mounted on a kodo like i was. The height makes a big difference. | Bucket spawns at any of the 4 troll camps along the river as well as the top of Skulk rock. Can be a bit annoying to find. Just run up and back and hope no one loots and makes it respawn."

Make this quest easier on yourself.

Go to Feralas and kill the Frayfeather Hypogryphs. They DO count towards the quest and definitely drop the long elegant feathers more often than the Hinterlands Gryphons.

There are plenty of them just below the yeti cave around 55,60.

Happy hunting! | These feathers are used in some crafting recipes. If you have trouble finding them off mobs, check the AH. | Did this in about thirty minutes, killing the trained razorbeaks quite near Aerie Peak. They have a good drop %, are low level so easy as hell to kill, & while waiting for them to respawn which doesn't take long at all you can easily pop down the path to Hillsbrad & kill Granistad, Kudros and the couple of wild gryphons flying about near them for extra feathery goodness. | Subject: ""GO RIGHT BELOW ""AERIE PEAK""""
Im telling you right now , if you dont go below aerie peak in The Hinterlands to do this quest, and your running around all over the Hinterlands trying to find these things, you'll be there for DAYS. Theres bout 20 of these hypogriphes in The Hinterlands, not joking. 10-12 of them are spread out all over The Hinterlands, and about 8 of them are right below Aerie Peak. So you have two choices. Run around all over trying to find those 10 spread out ones. Or go below Aerie Peak, kill the 8 that are close to eachother there , and wait for respawns. I tried the hard way , not knowing this batch was down there at Aerie Peak. It took me 2 hours to get 7 feathers... Then i find this place and get my last 3 in a matter of 3-5 minutes. | Subject: ""Long elegant feathers""
After reading previous posts I went to try in Feralas. Feather dropped from first one I killed, but then spent 45 minutes not getting any more. Went to Hinterlands where the droprate from the gryphon's at Aerie's Peak was around 1 in 3. Took 30 minutes to finish there. | Subject: ""Hey, read this!""
Just in case nobody already saw.. yes they do drop from the Hippogryphs 16,54 and as well they are all over the Hinterlands. But, the Witherbark Trolls at 31, 58 also drop them.

I've gotten two already from killing 5 of the Witherbark's. Uhm, that and the Hippogryph's are good.

The drop rate isn't that good, but they do drop, so don't get frustrated!"

7844,Cannibalistic Cousins,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7844,"Subject: ""Notes about""
The soothsayers spawn in groups of two inside the wooden forts at 65,44 and 70, 49.  The rest of the Vilebranch that you need are positioned around these two areas.  Watch out for the walkers, there is a pair of them at each site. | There are two areas where these mobs spawn. The first (and most popular) are the three enclosed camps near the river, east of Skulk Rock. The camps have two Soothsayers inside them, and are guarded by about six Scalpers, two of which patrol all the way around the camp. As there are only three camps, one run through all three will only net you a little over half the mobs you need.

The other area is the Altar of Zuul. This is the same place where you get the sacred mallet needed in Zul'Farrak. All around the altar (without going up the steps) you can find scalpers and soothsayers. There are also axe-throwers and wolf pups though, so watch for wandering mobs.

If you clean out the three camps first, then kill all the soothsayers/scalpers near the altar, you can go back to the camps to get the last few kills you need. Things should have respawned by then.

While you're going through the camps, be sure to grab the quest from the blacksmith in Revantusk Village. You'll likely find his tools in one of the camps. | Subject: ""LOTS of soothsayers""
There are A LOT of soothsayers in the Altar of Zul area, 48,66, a few scattered scalpers too, just be careful going to the top of the temple, there are two lvl 50 elites up there. :D"

7940,1200 Tickets - Orb of the Darkmoon,https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=7940,"To get the 1200 tickets needed for this, you'll need to do 60 turnins at 20 tickets each.
It depends greatly on your server's economy on which way is cheapest... Typically it's dense stone, but sometimes it's thorium bars.
Here's a quick way to find out how much it's going to cost you per turnin:
Multiply the cost of one stack (20) of each item by the number of stacks per turnin: 2 for rugged leather, 1.6 for dense stone, and for the widgets, .9 * Thorium Bars + .3 * Runecloth.
Therefore, let's say that on your server, thorium bars cost 3g a stack, runecloth 1g, rugged leather 2g and dense stone 2g.
That means each turn in costs 3g for thorium, 4g for leather, and 3.2g for stone. (for a total of 180g for 1200)
Now you usually will end up using a combination, depending on what is on the AH at any given time, or your own farming skills, but this is a handy tool for those who plan on buying a majority of it."
